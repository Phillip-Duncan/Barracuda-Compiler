# MathStack CPU VM
+ This program allows for the emulations of the MathStack VM. The MathStack language
  was developed to be run parallel on CUDA cores on a GPU. This has a few technical
  difficulties in debugging and testing programs developed. This emulator hopes to
  solve those problems by being an emulator/debugger and is being developed to develop
  a high-level language for the MathStack Assembly.
  
## Execution
+ The emulator can be executed using the `cargo run -- <filename>` command
  + In the future the filename will be used to denote the program to run. At
    this stage it is unimplemented but still checked, so you can just put in a random
    string to get the program to run
  + There is no way to run a program currently other than modifying the source files or
    by running the tests.
+ The emulator was developed on the rust build 1.59.0.

## Testing
+ Tests can be run by using the `cargo test` command.
+ These tests can be found in `src/test` folder

## Documentation
+ Documentation can be generated by using the `cargo doc` command.

## Contact
+ Feel free to submit PR's or leave issues on the git page.
