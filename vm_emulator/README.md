# Barracuda CPU VM
+ This program allows for the emulations of the Barracuda VM. The Barracuda language
  was developed to be run parallel on CUDA cores on a GPU. This has a few technical
  difficulties in debugging and testing programs developed. This emulator hopes to
  solve those problems by being an emulator/debugger and is being developed to develop
  a high-level language for the Barracuda Assembly.
  
## Execution
+ The emulator can be executed using the `cargo run -- <filename>` command
  + The filename entered is parsed and run in the emulator. Each line of the file
  is either a instruction/operation/value.
  + The execution can be debugged with the `--debug` argument.
+ The emulator was developed on the rust build 1.59.0.

## Testing
+ Tests can be run by using the `cargo test` command.
+ These tests can be found in `src/test` folder

## Documentation
+ Documentation can be generated by using the `cargo doc` command.

## Contact
+ Feel free to submit PR's or leave issues on the git page.
